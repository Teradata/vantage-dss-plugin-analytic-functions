Briefly, at each iteration, the probability that a row is selected is proportional to the value in the weight.column multiplied by the distance from the nearest row in the set of selected rows (as in ta.kmeans++). However, the ta.kmeans|| algorithm oversamples at each iteration, significantly reducing the required number of iterations; therefore, the resulting set of rows might have more than k data points. Each row in the resulting set is then weighted by the number of rows in the table that are closer to that row than to any other selected row, and the rows are clustered to produce exactly k rows.
